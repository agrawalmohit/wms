## Development History

### Initial Requirements Gathering
**User Story**: "continue with test by installing latest node version 18.17.0 and then we will continue with rest of work"
- Set up development environment
- Established Node.js and tooling requirements

### Farmer Identification Enhancement
**User Story**: "In order to uniquely identify farmer, we need to have Name, Father's Name, Village. Father's name is missing"
- Added fatherName field to farmer registration
- Implemented unique identification system
- Updated farmer selection throughout application

### Inventory System Development  
**User Story**: "we need inventory where we can select a unique farmer and then we need to have 3 categories of potato (mota, gulla, kirri). For each category, we need to have number of bags and for weight calculation we will take weight of 5 bags and then calculate average and then total weight."
- Implemented comprehensive inventory management
- Added 3 potato quality categories with color coding
- Built 5-bag weight sampling system
- Created automatic weight calculations
- Added real-time totals and summary statistics

### Location System Refinement
**User Story**: "place of stock (sthan) format can be roomnumber/floornumber/blocknumber which is understood"
- Implemented Room/Floor/Block location format
- Added lot number generation and assignment
- Created location tracking throughout system

### Terminology Standardization
**User Story**: "instead of location, we can call it lot number"
- Updated all references from "location" to "lot number"
- Standardized terminology across interface
- Updated documentation and labels

### Dependency Management Crisis
**Issue**: "I used pnpm to update all dependencies and now npm run dev is not working"
- Resolved dependency version conflicts
- Stabilized development environment

### Version Control Implementation
**User Story**: "instead can you add .tool-version to the project and configure the nodejs version as 20.10.0, pnpm version as 8.15.7 and use it"
- Added .tool-versions file for version management
- Implemented asdf version manager integration
- Established consistent development environment

### Workflow Optimization
**User Story**: "lot assignment screen is not required as lot is assigned during inventory"
- Removed redundant lot assignment interface
- Streamlined workflow to eliminate duplicate data entry
- Simplified lot management to focus on monitoring

### Stock Withdrawal Implementation
**User Story**: "As we have new stock entry which we call in local language as amad. We need to have form for stock debit which we call in hindi as nikasi."
- Built complete stock withdrawal system
- Implemented farmer selection with lot number reference
- Added quality-wise bag tracking
- Created withdrawal history and reporting

### Interface Simplification
**User Story**: "No need to have average weight and total weight in this form."
- Simplified withdrawal interface to bag counts only
- Removed weight calculations from withdrawal process
- Streamlined form layout and user experience

### Error Resolution and Optimization
- Resolved Next.js build cache issues
- Fixed module resolution problems
- Optimized development server performance
